# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS
A few projects I worked on in this course
## Projects
*Pizza Menu
*Tic Tac Toe
*Academy Cinemas

### Pizza Menu
This project made a menu that you used to order a pizza. You can 
choose the size of the pizza and all the toppings you want. Then it 
takes all the information you selected and gives you the price.

### Tic Tac Toe
This program lets you play the simple old game of Tic Tac Toe against
the computer. The program rolls dice and chooses who will go first and whoever wins
will get a celebratory music.

###Academy Cinemas
Although I wrote this code in a earlier course we did go back to it to add javascript to it.
In this program you can now choose which of 3 movies you'd like to see and also see their ratings.
After choosing the movie, time, and how many tickets it will give you a popup that tells you what you
just selected.
