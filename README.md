# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS
A few projects I worked on in this course
## Projects
*Pizza Menu
*Tic Tac Toe
*Academy Cinemas

### Pizza Menu
This project made a menu that you used to order a pizza. You can 
choose the size of the pizza and all the toppings you want. Then it 
takes all the information you selected and gives you the price.

### Tic Tac Toe
This program lets you play the simple old game of Tic Tac Toe against
the computer. The program rolls dice and chooses who will go first and whoever wins
will get a celebratory music.

###Academy Cinemas
This program is a website to a movie theater. It has a few movies with star ratings 
connected to each movie poster. At the bottom of the page you can select your movie, the show time, and the 
number of tickets. When you click buy tickets the program finds what information you inputed in for each category
and gives you a pop up that stays in the middle of your screen showing what you just purchased.
